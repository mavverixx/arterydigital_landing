# Artery Digital - Junior Frontend Developer Task

This is my submission for the Junior Frontend Developer practical task. The goal was to build a responsive, pixel-perfect medical website landing page based on the provided design files.

### Task Requirements Checklist

- [x] Build a responsive medical website landing page from the provided design.
- [x] Use HTML and CSS.
- [x] Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling, as encouraged.
- [x] Ensure the build is responsive and functional on mobile devices.
- [x] No JavaScript or backend code was required or used.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
- **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling, layout, and responsiveness, implemented via the official CDN.
- **Google Fonts:** For the 'Roboto' typeface.
- **Git & GitHub:** For version control and deployment via GitHub Pages.

### Approach

My approach was to build this as a "mobile-first" layout, ensuring the core structure was sound on a small screen before scaling up to the desktop view using Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`md:`, `lg:`).

I used Flexbox and Grid to manage the layout of the content sections and cards, ensuring a clean and maintainable structure. The complex, overlapping background elements were handled with absolute positioning and z-index to accurately match the original design.
